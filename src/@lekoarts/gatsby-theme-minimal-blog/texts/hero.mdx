Hello, world!

This is an engineering blog where I jot down my journey to being a Software Engineer. It will be about anything I happen to learn on a daily basis, and maybe some experience I'd like to share being someone who transition into a tech career late in their life :)

You can think of it as your daily 5' engineering read! Now grab your coffee and let's get started.
