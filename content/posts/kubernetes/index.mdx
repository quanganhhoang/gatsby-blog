## Why Kubernetes? 

- Container Orchestration
- Deploy services, roll out new releases without downtime. Scale up/down services.
- Portable
- Self healing
- Load balance requests and monitor resources
- Easy access to logs


## `kubectl` & `minikube`


Start Minikube to create a cluster

    # create a new VM based on Minikube image
    # image contains Docker, rkt container engines and localkube library
    minikube start --vm-driver=virtualbox

    # stop
    minikube stop

    # delete cluster: no data or state is preserved
    minikube delete

    minikube status

    minikube dashboard

    # checking env variables
    minikube docker-env


Configuring the shell

    # every command we send to local Docker client will be excecuted on Minikube VM
    eval $(minikube docker-env)


Verification

    docker container ls

    minikube ssh
    docker container ls
    exit

    kubectl config current-context
    kubectl get nodes
    kubectl get all --all-namespaces


## Pods

A Pod encapsulates one or more containers. It provides a unique network IP, attaches storage resources, and also decides how containers should run. Everything in a Pod is tightly coupled.

Create a Pod with Mongo

    kubectl run db --image mongo --generator "run-pod/v1"

    # verify
    kubectl get pods
    eval $(minikube docker-env)
    docker container ls -f ancestor=mongo

    # delete
    kubectl delete pod db


Define Pods via yaml

    # example - db.yml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
        name: db
        labels:
            type: db
            vendor: MongoLabs
    spec:
        containers:
        - name: db
            image: mongo:3.3
            command: ["mongod"]
            args: ["--rest", "--httpinterface"]

    # create pod defined in db.yml
    kubectl create -f db.yml

    kubectl describe -f db.yml


### Components and stages in a Pod's scheduling

1. API Server
    - Runs on the master node
    - All other components interact with API server and keep watch for changes

2. Scheduler
    - Runs on the master node
    - Watch for unassigned pods and assign them to a node which has available resources (CPU and memory) matching Pod requirements

3. Kubelet
    - Runs on each node
    - Makes sure assigned pods are running on the node
    - If a Pod is assigned to the node Kubelet is running on, it pulls the Pod definition and create containers accordingly
