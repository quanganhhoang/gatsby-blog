I started teaching myself programming at the beginning of 2017 and have taken countless online courses, most of which are free and the rest at a discount. 
This is a list of resources that I found helpful, broken down to categories where I think will be useful for someone who has just started out.

#To the readers: please reach out to me if you have any recommendations and I will gladly add them to my list. This blog post is meant to help ease others into programming and avoid bombarding them with irrelevant information.


### What is programming? How do I start?

There are lots of specializations out there when it comes to programming, as you might have seen a few such as Frontend Developer, Backend Developer, Full Stack Engineer, Security, DevOps, etc. 
However, we don't need to worry about what they all mean for now, as it's something you will inevitably learn about with more experience in your belt.

Let's start with two of the broadest terms `Backend` vs `Frontend`. This should be enough for us to dive into programming with hopefully some fun projects! 


### Frontend

You can think of frontend as the stuff that makes your websites pretty. Every text, style, color and animation you see is `frontend`. Of course, there is more to that but we will get there later.


#### Things to know

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript


#### Relevant skills

UI Libraries:
- React
- Angular

Frontend framework:
- Bootstrap
- Styled components
- ...


#### Projects
- Make your own website with React and host it on gh-pages, AWS or heroku
- Make an e-commerce website
- Make a blog page

### Backend

You can think of backend as all the server and database stuff that powers any website. It handles data ETL and sends/receives data to and from the `frontend`, whether it is user authentication, data manipulation or more.


#### Things to know

These are arguably the easiest languages to pick up with lots of documentation online. Try them all but focus on one and try to master it. For reference, most people master either python or java for their coding interviews.
- Java
- Python
- Javascript (Nodejs)


#### Relevant skills
- Languages: Python, Java, C++, Go, etc. See job postings.
- REST
- Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) such as MySQL, Postgres
