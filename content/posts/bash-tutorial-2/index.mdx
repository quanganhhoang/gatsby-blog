## awk

Shell variables
- `$NF` : awk's built in variable that holds number of fields found on current line


Tricks
- `read -a LSL` : reads a line at a time and each word is assigned to an entry in the array LSL


awk utility reads data from the filename supplied, or from stdin if no filename is given

    awk '{print $1}' myinput.file

    awk '{print $1}' < myinput.file

    cat myinput.file | awk '{print $1}'


Reverse words on a line

    $ awk '{
    >    for (i=NF; i>=0; i--) {
    >        printf "%s ", $i;
    >    }
    >    printf "\n"
    > }' <filename>

    # one liner
    awk '{for (i=NF; i>=0; i--) {printf "%s ", $i;} printf "\n" }'<filename>


Summing a list of numbers

    # sum up the file sizes from the output of an `ls` command
    ls -l | awk '{sum += $5}; END {print sum}'

    # calls `next` command for ^total block
    ls -l | awk '/^total/{next} {sum += $5}; END {print sum}'


Counting string values with bash

    # # cookbook filename: cnt_owner
    # count owners of a file using bash
    # pipe "ls -l" into this script

    declare -A AACOUNT
    while read  -a LSL
    do
        # only consider lines that are 7 words or longer
        if (( ${#LSL[*]} > 7 ))     # the size of the array
        then
            NDX=${LSL[3]}                 # string assign
            (( AACOUNT[${NDX}] += 1 ))    # math increment
        fi
    done

    for VALS in "${!AACOUNT[@]}"      # index of each element
    do
        echo $VALS "owns" ${AACOUNT[$VALS]} "files"
    done
