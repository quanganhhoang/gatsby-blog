If you are reading this post, congratulations on your success thus far. You already know which companies you want to work for and when you are going to submit your applications.
Everyone has different pace and I believe there is no best way to prepare for interviews other than practicing, practicing and practicing. 
However, the intensity of your practice will greatly depend on your schedule and what fits you.
What follows is what worked for me and I only hope you will get something out of it, either the whole plan or bits of it.

<br />

### When should I start preparing? General goals?

- Language: Java

Pick your strongest language and keep working at it. Know the libraries and how they work.
Practice implementing several data structures like HashMap, HashSet, Stack, Queue, Trie, etc. to learn their inner workings.

- Timeline: 6 months
- Leetcode: 2 questions/day

This was the timeline that I set for myself, which got me to be comfortable with solving algorithms questions while avoiding burnout.
Two a day I promised myself, but I made those two count. Take notes of techniques, similar questions, etc. This should take you about 1 to 2 hours/day.

- Weekly leetcode contests on Fridays
- Weekly mock interviews after you're somewhat comfortable with medium questions
- Weekly mock phone interviews for roughly a month before your interviews

Practice your composure in a time constraint setting. The first few seconds matter. 
The goal here is not to panic when you see an unfamiliar question. Apply your reasoning, draw out similarities and tackle your problems one by one.
It is your explanations and problem solving skills that make an impact. At the end of the day, there are only so many techniques that you need to know.
If a question is so tricky that you have no idea to even approach it, it is time to ask for a hint and invite your interviewer to work with you.


- Keep working on your projects and widen your programming knowledge

Preparing for interviews might be exhausting and honestly, it doesn't make you a better programmer. Don't make leetcoding your daily life.
Keep working on interesting projects of your own and don't let burnout take away your passion.

<br />

### Strategies

<br />

#### What Should I Expect?

Most of internship interviews will be on algorithms and last about 45 minutes each. Questions will be either easy, medium or hard (rarely).
All of my interviews consisted of either two medium questions or one with a follow-up.

<br />

#### Resources

- Leetcode
- Hackerank
- Cracking the Coding Interview (Introduction)
- Elements of Programming Interviews (Intermediate)

<br />

#### First stage - Breadth

- Read Cracking the Coding Interview to refresh your algorithms knowledge
- Do ~50 random easy questions on Leetcode/Hackerank
- Take note of various techniques you see

The idea here is to ease yourself into solving algorithms questions. Don't be disappointed if you don't know how do them yet. Read other people's solutions and learn from it. 
And don't spend too much time trying to solve them either. Remember, two a day, make it count.

<br />

#### Second stage - Depth

- Read Elements of Programming Interviews
- Leetcode/Hackerank: Pick a topic and only do questions on that topic for a week
- Again, take notes of techniques and similar questions

The idea here is to deep dive into each algorithm topic and master it.

Here are the topics that I focused on by week:

1. Bits Manipulation
2. Arrays
3. Strings
4. LinkedLists
5. Stacks and Queues
6. Binary Trees
7. Heaps
8. Searching
9. Hash Tables
10. Sorting
11. Binary Search Trees
12. Recursion
13. Dynamic Programming
14. Greedy Algorithms
15. Graphs

<br />

#### Third stage - Review

- Redo your questions
- Take mock interviews on Leetcode and try to finish them as fast as possible

Your goal here is to remember the patterns and be able to draw out similarities so that you can tackle any new questions accurately and quickly.

<br />

#### Mock interviews

Get someone at the same pace as you and keep working at it. Set out things that you want to improve on and ask your partner to consistenly call you out until you remember it.

Here are the things you need to look out for:

- Confirm input/output. Don't forget what the question is asking you.
- Ask for an example or make one yourself to understand the question better
- Talk out loud your thoughts
- Verbalize where you are stuck so your interviewer can help you
- Pinpoint where you need a hint and ask for it
- Do not code right away! Ask your interviewer if he/she is satisfied with your approach and whether they'd like to see your code
- Don't get hung up on one thing, especially when it is not important to your logic. Ask if you can come back to it at the end.
- State your time/space complexities.


Last but not least, relax and enjoy the journey. Give yourself a pat in the back and acknowledge that hard work you are putting in.
It will definitely pay off.

**Good luck!**
