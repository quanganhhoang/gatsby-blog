Hi!

I'm QA.

I took **ONE** engineering class in college and thought I was not cut out for it. Fast forward to post graduation, I found myself giving programming another chance (because why not!?) and have been loving it since :)

I wrote my first line of code in 2017. I then worked as a data engineer for two years then went back to school to pursue a Master's in Computer Science.
